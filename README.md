## Overview

GiftChain is designed to make crypto gifting as simple as sending a message. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, claiming, and managing crypto gifts, with features like expiration dates, secure transfers, and blockchain transparency. At its core, GiftChain is designed to prioritize user privacy by concealing the sender's address, thereby safeguarding against on-chain scruitny.

---

## Features

- **Create Gift Cards**: Users can create crypto gift cards with customizable amounts and expiration dates.
- **Claim Gifts**: Recipients can claim their crypto gifts securely.
- **Reclaim Gifts**: Unclaimed gifts can be reclaimed by the sender after expiration.
- **Anonymity**: Sender's address is concealed against on-chain scrutiny.
- **Subgraph Integration**: Real-time querying of blockchain data using The Graph.

graph deploy --node https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ <subgraph-name>
```


## Smart Contracts

### Overview

The GiftChain smart contract is the backbone of the application, enabling the creation, claiming, and reclaiming of crypto gifts. It is written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract ensures secure and transparent handling of gift transactions while prioritizing user privacy and efficiency.


### Key Features

1. Gift Creation:

- Users can create a gift by specifying:
    - The token address (ERC20).
    - The amount to gift.
    - An expiration date.
    - A personalized message (3 to 50 characters).
- The gift is stored on-chain with a unique giftID and marked as PENDING.

2. Gift Claiming:

- Recipients can claim a gift if:
    -The gift is in a PENDING state.
    -The gift has not expired.
    -The recipient is not the creator of the gift.
- Upon claiming, the gift's status is updated to CLAIMED, and the tokens are transferred to the recipient.

3. Gift Reclaiming:

- If a gift is not claimed before its expiration date, the creator can reclaim it.
- Reclaiming is only allowed if:
    -The gift is in a PENDING state.
    -The gift has expired.
- Upon reclaiming, the gift's status is updated to RECLAIMED, and the tokens are returned to the creator.

4.Gift Validation:

- Users can validate a gift's status to check if it is:
    - PENDING (ready to be claimed).
    - CLAIMED (already claimed).
    - RECLAIMED (already reclaimed).
    - Invalid (non-existent or expired).


## Subgraph 

The subgraph is used to index and query blockchain data in real-time. It is built using The Graph and provides APIs for querying gift card transactions.

Key Files
- schema.graphql: Defines the data structure.
- mappings/: Contains mapping functions for processing blockchain events.
